## Introduction

## Objective

The objective for this project is as follows:

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

More specifically, the following is required:

Functioning CRUD application created in Python
Functioning front-end to website using Flask
Trello board or equivalent
Relational database - must contain at least one one-to-many relationship
Clear documentation
Detailed risk assessment

## Proposal
